# STEM-Outcomes-at-Whitman-College
This is part of study on first-year students and which do STEM degrees at Whitman College, using data the Office of Institutional Research provided the former instructor of this class, Prof. Schueller, with the courses and grades of all courses taken at Whitman College by first-year students from 2002-2018. In a separate data set, they provided the degrees those students ultimately earned 3 years later along with some demographic information. The two data sets are anonymized with random student ID numbers that correlate between the two data sets. For example, in the first dataset I can extract all the courses taken by ID 2823 and their grades, and in the second I can get the demographic info and degree earned by ID 2823.
